Louise Bourgeois (1911â€“2010) was a French-American artist. She is best known for her large-scale sculpture and installation art, and was also a prolific painter and printmaker. She explored domesticity and the family, sexuality and the body, and death and the unconscious. These themes connect to events from her childhood which she considered to be a therapeutic process. She exhibited with the Abstract Expressionists and her work has much in common with Surrealism and Feminist art.
