Mesoamerican mythologies include religions, shamanistic elements, and complex polytheistic beliefs. The great breadth is due to the incorporation of ideological and religious elements from the first primitive religion of Fire, Earth, Water and Nature. Astral divinities (the sun, stars, constellations, and Venus) are represented in anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and anthropozoomorphic ways.There is an emphasis on dualism: the positive, exemplified by light, the masculine, force, war, the sun, etc.; and the negative, exemplified by darkness, the feminine, repose, peace, the moon, etc.
