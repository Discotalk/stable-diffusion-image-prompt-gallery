Gustav Klimt (1862â€“1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and a prominent member of the Vienna Secession movement. Klimt is noted for his paintings, murals, sketches, and other objets d'art. Klimt's primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by eroticism. Klimt was influenced by Japanese art and its methods. He achieved success with the paintings of his "golden phase", many of which include gold leaf.
