Arthurian legends are about King Arthur (Welsh: Brenin Arthur, Cornish: Arthur Gernow, Breton: Roue Arzhur). According to medieval histories and romances, Arthur was leader of the Celtic Britons in battles against Saxon invaders. Arthur is a central figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain. Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh otherworld Annwn. The legends often include Merlin the magician, Guinevere the queen, Excalibur the sword, and the Knights of the Round Table.
