Josephine Wall (1947–) is an English fantasy artist and sculptor. She studied at Bournemouth College and worked at Poole Pottery as a designer and painter of Delphis Ware. Her pottery figures include characters from Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and mythological creatures. Her paintings are inspired by Arthur Rackham, surrealist artists such as Magritte and Dalí, and the romanticism of the pre-Raphaelites.
