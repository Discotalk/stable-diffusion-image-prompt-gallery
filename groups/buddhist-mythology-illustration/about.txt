Buddhist traditions have created and maintained a vast body of mythological literature. The central myth of Buddhism is the life of the Buddha. The chief motif of this story, and the most distinctive feature of Buddhist myth, is the Buddha's renunciation, leaving his home and family for a spiritual quest. The traditions contain large numbers of smaller stories, which are usually supposed to convey an ethical or Buddhist teaching. Since these are regarded as episodes in the life of the Buddha, they are treated here as “myth”, rather than distinguishing between myth, legend, and folk-tale.
