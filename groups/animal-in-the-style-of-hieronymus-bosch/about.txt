Hieronymus Bosch (c.1450â€“1516) was a Dutch/Netherlandish painter from Brabant. He is one of the most notable representatives of the Early Netherlandish painting school. His work, generally oil on oak wood, mainly contains fantastic illustrations of religious concepts and narratives. Bosch is seen as a hugely individualistic painter with deep insight into humanity's deepest desires and deepest fears.
