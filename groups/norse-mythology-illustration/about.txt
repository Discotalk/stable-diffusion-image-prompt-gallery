Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes. The mythology centers on the plights of the gods and their interaction with several other beings, such as humanity and the jötnar, beings who may be friends, lovers, foes, or family members of the gods. The cosmos consists of Nine Worlds that flank a central sacred tree, Yggdrasil. Units of time and elements of cosmology are personified as deities or beings. The world is created from the flesh of the primordial being Ymir, and the first two humans are Ask and Embla. Worlds are foretold to be reborn after Ragnarök, an immense battle between the gods and their enemies.
