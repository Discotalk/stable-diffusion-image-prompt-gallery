Tamara de Łempicka (1898–1980) was a Polish painter who spent her working life in France and the United States. She is best known for her polished Art Deco portraits of aristocrats and the wealthy, and for her highly stylized paintings of nudes. Her style was a blend of late, refined cubism and the neoclassical style. Her work made a comeback in the late 1960s, with the rediscovery of Art Deco.
