Inuit religion is the shared spiritual beliefs and practices of the Inuit, an indigenous people from Alaska, northern Canada, parts of Siberia and Greenland. Traditional Inuit religious practices include animism and shamanism, in which spiritual healers mediate with spirits. The Inuit cosmos is ruled by no one. There are no divine mother and father figures, no wind gods and solar creators, no eternal punishments, and no punishments for children or adults in the here and now. Traditional stories, rituals, and taboos of the Inuit are often precautions against dangers posed by their harsh Arctic environment.
