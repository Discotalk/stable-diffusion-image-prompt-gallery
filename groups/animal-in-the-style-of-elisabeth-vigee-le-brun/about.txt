Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun (1755–1842) was a French portrait painter, especially of women, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Her artistic style is generally considered part of the aftermath of Rococo with elements of an adopted Neoclassical style. She enjoyed the patronage of European aristocrats, actors, and writers, and was elected to art academies in ten cities.
