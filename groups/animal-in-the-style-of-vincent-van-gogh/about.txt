Vincent van Gogh (1853â€“1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In a decade, he created about 2,100 artworks. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art.
