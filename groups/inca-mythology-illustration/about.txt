Inca mythology or religion includes many stories and legends that attempt to explain or symbolize Inca beliefs. The Incas permitted the cultures they integrated into their empire to keep their individual religions. For example the Runa (Quechua speakers') belief systems were integrated with their view of the cosmos. Stories depict the movements of constellations, planets, and planetary formations, which are connected to agricultural cycles, annual cycles, 800-year cycles. This timekeeping ensured cultural transmission of key information, in spite of regime change or social catastrophes.
