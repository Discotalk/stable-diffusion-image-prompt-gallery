Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960â€“1988) was an American artist who rose to success in the 1980s Neo-expressionism movement. Basquiat's art focused on dichotomies of wealth versus poverty, integration versus segregation, and inner versus outer experience. He appropriated poetry, drawing, and painting, and married text and image, abstraction and historical information. He used social commentary for introspection, identification with the Black community, and attacks on power structures and systems of racism.
