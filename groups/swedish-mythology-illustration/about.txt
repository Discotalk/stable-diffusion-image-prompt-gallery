Swedish mythology is related to Norse mythology. Swedes (Swedish: svenskar) are a North Germanic ethnic group native to the Nordic region, primarily their nation state of Sweden. Swedes enter written proto-history as a powerful tribe (distinguished for their arms and men, and for their powerful fleets or longships. Which kings (kuningaz) ruled these Suiones is unknown, but mythology presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. Later, the Swedish Viking Age lasted roughly between the 8th and 11th centuries. The adventures of these Swedish Vikings are commemorated on many runestones in Sweden.
