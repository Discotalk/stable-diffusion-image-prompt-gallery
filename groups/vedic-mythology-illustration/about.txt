The historical Vedic religion (also known as Vedicism, Vedism or ancient Hinduism), and subsequently Brahmanism, constituted the religious ideas and practices among some of the Indo-Aryan peoples of northwest Indian Subcontinent. Specific rituals and sacrifices of the Vedic religion include, among others: the Soma rituals; Fire rituals involving oblations (havir); and the Ashvamedha (horse sacrifice). The rites of grave burials as well as cremation are seen since the Rigvedic period. Deities emphasized in the Vedic religion include Dyaus, Indra, Agni, Rudra and Varuna, and important ethical concepts include satya and á¹›ta.
