Vodun means spirit in the Fon, Gun and Ewe languages; also spelled Vodon, Vodoun, Vodou, Vudu, Voudou, Voodoo, etc.. Vodun is a religion practiced by the Aja, Ewe, and Fon peoples of Benin, Togo, Ghana, and Nigeria. Elements of the West African religion survived slavery and evolved into religions in the New World among the African diaspora in the Americas. Vodun cosmology centers around the vodun spirits and other elements of divine essence that govern the Earth, a hierarchy that range in power from major deities governing the forces of nature and human society to the spirits of individual streams, trees, and rocks, as well as dozens of ethnic vodun, defenders of a certain clan, tribe, or nation.
