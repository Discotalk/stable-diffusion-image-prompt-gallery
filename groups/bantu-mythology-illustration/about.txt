Bantu mythology is the system of beliefs and legends of the Bantu people of Africa. Although Bantu peoples account for several hundred different ethnic groups, there is a high degree of homogeneity in Bantu cultures, customs, and llanguages. Generally, these traditions are oral and passed down from one generation to another through folk tales, songs, and festivals. These include belief in an amount of higher and lower gods, veneration of the dead, use of magic and traditional African medicine. Most religions can be described as animistic with various polytheistic and pantheistic aspects.
