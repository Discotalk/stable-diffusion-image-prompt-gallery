Pan Yuliang (1895–1977) was a Chinese painter, renowned as the first woman in China to paint in the Western style. She studied in Shanghai and Paris. Her modernist works drew severe criticism in China during the 1930s, and Pan returned to Paris in 1937 to live and work for the next 40 years. She taught at the École des Beaux Arts. Her art evolved within the flux of transformations where conflicting dichotomies of East and West, tradition and modernity, male chauvinism and emerging feminism co-existed.
