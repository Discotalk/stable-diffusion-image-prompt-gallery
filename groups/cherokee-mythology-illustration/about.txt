Cherokee spiritual beliefs are held in common among the Cherokee people â€“ Native American peoples who are indigenous to the Southeastern Woodlands. Cherokee cosmology includes a conception of the universe being composed of three connected worlds: the Upper World and the Under World, which are the domains of the spirits, and This World, where humans live. Plants, animals, and other features of the natural world such as rivers, mountains, caves and other formations on the earth all have spiritual powers and attributes. Humans live in coexistence with all of creation, and mediate between all worlds to balance them.
