Polynesian mythology, also known as The Polynesian narrative, encompasses the oral traditions of the people of a grouping of Pacific Ocean island archipelagos in the Polynesian Triangle. In some myths, the god of the sea and of fishing is of great importance. There is often a story of the marriage between Sky and Earth. There are stories of islands pulled up from the bottom of the sea by a magic fishhook or thrown down from heaven. There are stories of voyages, migrations, seductions, and battles. There are stories about a trickster named MƒÅui, and a beautiful goddess/ancestress Hina or Sina.
