Wikipedia: A dragonfly is a flying insect. Most are tropical, with fewer species in temperate regions. Many dragonflies have brilliant iridescent or metallic colours produced by structural colouration, making them conspicuous in flight. Dragonflies are predatory. They are fast, agile fliers capable of highly accurate aerial ambush, sometimes migrating across oceans, and often live near water. They are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness in Japan, but seen as sinister in European folklore.

Wikipedia: Hummingbirds are birds native to the Americas, and the vast majority of the species are found in the tropics around the equator. They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their beating wings, which flap at high frequencies audible to humans. They hover in mid-air at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around 12 beats per second in the largest species to around 80 per second in small hummingbirds. Hummingbirds have the highest mass-specific metabolic rate of any homeothermic animal.

Wikipedia: Butterflies are insects. Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. Butterflies have a four-stage life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the adult insect climbs out, and after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Butterflies are often polymorphic, and many species make use of camouflage, mimicry, and aposematism to evade their predators.

Wikipedia: A honeybee (also spelled honey bee) is a eusocial flying insect, native to Afro-Eurasia.] After bees spread naturally throughout Africa and Eurasia, humans became responsible for the current cosmopolitan distribution of honey bees. Honey bees are known for their construction of perennial colonial nests from wax, the large size of their colonies, and surplus production and storage of honey, distinguishing their hives as a prized foraging target of many animals, including honey badgers, bears and human hunter-gatherers. Modern humans also use beeswax in making candles, soap, lip balms and various cosmetics, as a lubricant and in mould-making using the lost wax process.
  
Wikipedia: A songbird is a bird belonging to the suborder Passeri of the perching birds (Passeriformes). The Passeriformes contains 5000 or so species found all over the world, in which the vocal organ typically is developed in such a way as to produce a diverse and elaborate bird song. The song in this clade is essentially territorial, because it communicates the identity and whereabouts of an individual to other birds, and also signals intentions. Selection among songbirds is highly based on mimetic vocalization; the larger a songbird's repertoire, the more it attracts mating songbirds.

Wikipedia: Parrots are birds, many vividly coloured, found mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. Parrots, along with ravens, crows, jays, and magpies, are among the most intelligent birds, and the ability of some species to imitate human speech enhances their popularity as pets. Parrots are the only creatures that display true tripedalism, using their necks and beaks as limbs. One-third of all parrot species are threatened by extinction; measures taken to conserve the habitats of some high-profile charismatic species have also protected many of the less charismatic species living in the same ecosystems.

## mythology illustration

Wikipedia: Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology is the sacred spirituality represented in the stories performed by Aboriginal Australians within each of the language groups across Australia in their ceremonies. Aboriginal spirituality includes the Dreamtime (the Dreaming), songlines, and oral literature. Aboriginal spirituality often conveys descriptions of each group's local cultural landscape, adding meaning to the whole country's topography from oral history told by ancestors from some of the earliest recorded history.

Wikipedia: Aztec mythology is the body or collection of myths of the Aztec civilization of Central Mexico. The Aztecs were Nahuatl-speaking groups living in central Mexico and much of their mythology is similar to that of other Mesoamerican cultures. According to legend, the various groups who were to become the Aztecs arrived from the north into the Anahuac valley around Lake Texcoco. The location of this valley and lake of destination is clear – it is the heart of modern Mexico City – but little can be known with certainty about the origin of the Aztec.

Wikipedia: Bantu mythology is the system of beliefs and legends of the Bantu people of Africa. Although Bantu peoples account for several hundred different ethnic groups, there is a high degree of homogeneity in Bantu cultures, customs, and llanguages. Generally, these traditions are oral and passed down from one generation to another through folk tales, songs, and festivals. These include belief in an amount of higher and lower gods, veneration of the dead, use of magic and traditional African medicine. Most religions can be described as animistic with various polytheistic and pantheistic aspects.

The chief motif of this story, and the most distinctive feature of Buddhist myth, is the Buddha's renunciation, leaving his home and family for a spiritual quest. The traditions contain large numbers of smaller stories, which are usually supposed to convey an ethical or Buddhist teaching. Since these are regarded as episodes in the life of the Buddha, they are treated here as “myth”, rather than distinguishing between myth, legend, and folk-tale.

Wikipedia: Celtic mythology is the body of myths belonging to the Celtic peoples. Like other Iron Age Europeans, Celtic peoples followed a polytheistic religion, having many gods and goddesses. The supernatural race called the Tuatha Dé Danann are believed to be based on the main Celtic gods of Ireland, while many Welsh characters belong either to the Plant Dôn ("Children of Dôn") and the Plant Llyr ("Children of Llyr"). One common figure is the sovereignty goddess, who represents the land. The Otherworld is also a common motif; a parallel realm of the supernatural races, which is visited by some mythical heroes. Celtic myth influenced later Arthurian legend.

Wikipedia: Chinese mythology is mythology that has been passed down in oral form or recorded in literature in the geographic area now known as Greater China.

Pictorial representations of gods, heroes, and mythic episodes featured prominently in the decoration of artifacts.

Wikipedia: Hindu mythology is the body of myths and literature attributed to, and espoused by, the adherents of the Hindu religion, found in Hindu texts such as the Vedic literature, epics like Mahabharata and Ramayana,[2] the Puranas, and regional literature like the Tamil Periya Puranam and Naalayira Divya Prabandham, and the Mangal Kavya of Bengal.

This article will discuss cosmogony, important deities, modern interpretations, cultural significance, and the influence of these myths.

Wikipedia: Maya mythology is part of Mesoamerican mythology and comprises all of the Maya tales in which personified forces of nature, deities, and the heroes interacting with these play the main roles. The myths of the Pre-Hispanic era have to be reconstructed from iconography.

Traditional beliefs are usually passed down in the forms of oral histories, stories, allegories, and principles.

The world is created from the flesh of the primordial being Ymir, and the first two humans are Ask and Embla.
