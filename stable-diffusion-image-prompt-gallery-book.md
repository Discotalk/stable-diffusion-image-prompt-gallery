# Welcome to Stable Diffusion

![](build/cover.png)


## What is Stable Diffusion?

Stable Diffusion is computer software that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to generate new kinds of images. 

The software enables you to type a phrase, such as "lucy in the sky with diamonds" or "mermaid underwater palace", then the software will generate new kinds of images that include a variety of astronauts, rockets, alients, planets, and the like.


### How does Stable Diffusion work?

Stable Diffusion works by analyzing millions of existing images, including each image's metadata, such as the image's tags on various social media websites.

Then the software combines the analyzed data, a user's text prompt, and random numbers. The result is new artwork that is blend of AI/ML and user-generated content.


### Where does Stable Diffusion come from?

Stable Diffusion is a creation of stability.ai.

https://stability.ai

The software is free open source. You're able to download it, install it, and run it.


## What is this book?

This book is a collection of many of our favorite Stable Diffusion generated images and their corresponding prompts.

All the book images are generated thanks to Stable Diffusion, a MacBook Pro, and reasonably simple prompts.


### This is free

This book is free open source. You're able to read it, keep it, and share it.

# Song mixing

This section shows images that are generated by prompts of song titles by musicians.

These images demonstrate that Stable Diffusion sometimes hones in on one specific style of image, such as the Halo video game for the songs by Beyoncé. Other times, Stable Diffusion creates a variety of styles, such as the different kinds of people and settings for the songs by Aretha Frankin.

### Image prompts

This section uses these image prompts:

* Halo & Energy & Summer Renaissance (Beyoncé)

* Black Magic Woman & The Game of Love (Santana)

* Amazing Grace & Day Dreaming (Aretha Franklin)

* Mirrorball & Wonderland (Taylor Swift)

* Yellow Submarine & Octopus's Garden (The Beatles)

* Just Dance & Perfect Illusion (Lady Gaga)

# Dancing people

This section shows images of dancing people in a variety of contexts, historical and modern.

These images demonstrate that Stable Diffusion can sometimes have a difficult time generating realistic faces and bodies. People who are skilled with Stable Diffusion sometimes decide to post-process images using more kinds of artificial intelligence and machine learning, to help fine-tune realistic faces and bodies.


### Image prompts

This section uses these image prompts:

* Electronica EDM festival with dancing people

* Edwardian Ball with people dancing in costume

* Bollywood movie with dancing people singing songs
  
* Burningman art with dancing people at night

# Fantasy fiction

This section shows fanstasy images, such as with unicorns, wizards, dragons, and more. 

These images demonstrate that fantasy is a topic area where Stable Diffusion really shines. This is thanks to a large variety of input images, as well as generally bold colors, similarilites of tropes in the input images, and being able to render faces more like illustration and less like photorealism.


### Image prompts

This section uses these image prompts:

* Unicorn galloping with rainbows

* Lord of the Rings Rivendell fantasy forest

* Wizard with a magic wand casting a spell

* Tarot card that can predict the future

* Pirate ship sails on ocean waves

* Legend of the Fountain of Youth

# Animal in the style of an artist

This section shows images in the style of many professional artists. The images show how randomly-chosen animals can look when generated in the style of the artist. 

These images demonstrate that Stable Diffuion artificial intelligence machine learning is able to "understand" the artists' styles. At the same time, it's important to know that Stable Diffusion created many more images that looked broken, or mistaken, or defective; we deleted these images.


### Image prompts

This section uses the image prompts "animal in the style of" with these artists' names:

* Alexander Calder

* Alma Thomas

* Amrita Sher-Gil

* Artemisia Gentileschi

* Berthe Morisot

* Catrin Welz-Stein

# Living places

This section shows images of living places, such as towns, apartments, cabins, and more. 

These images demonstrate that Stable Diffusion is able to handle architecture and buildings, more or less, such as generating a building on top of a background. Some of These images demonstrate that Stable Diffusion does have trouble doing some kinds of photrealistic perspectives, notably in the "classic apartment" images.


### Image prompts

This section uses these image prompts:

* Medieval castle with town faire

* Hobbit village in the Shire

* Seaside town painted like a watercolor

* Cabin in the woods by a stream with a mountain

* Classic apartment building on a busy street

* Painted tipis for Indigenous Native Americans

* Modernist design home architecture with a pool

# Delicious food


This section shows food images.

These images help demonstrate that Stable Diffusion generates high-quality photo-realistic images. 

The success of these images is likely because of many food bloggers sharing their food photos on social networks, plus many restaurant websites, menu websites, and recipie websites.

A notable error is in the breakfast images: Stable Diffusion doesn't seem to understand how to use the word "vegan".


### Image prompts

This section uses these image prompts:

* Delicious breakfast with vegan food

* Delicious lunch with healthy food

* Delicious dessert with tempting food

# Conclusion

Stable Diffusion uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to generate art. The images in this book are some of the millions of new images that Stable Diffusion is creating for people worldwide.

What you're seeing in this book is just the beginning. New advances are happening quickly, specifically in the Stable Diffusion software, and broadly in the fields of AI and ML.
